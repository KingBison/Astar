# Astar
A program for my artificial intelligence class that does pathfinding using the A* algorithm

once the gui is displayed, click a white box to select. Then, click another white box to find the path to it. If there is a path a red line will show the path. If not, both boxes will be unselected and you must try again. Once a path is shown, click another white square to clear the screen.
